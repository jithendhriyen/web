  Despite steps toward decreasing deforestation, uncontrolled wildfires are threatening environmental gains in Brazilian Amazonia, one of the world's most critical carbon sinks and a region of high biological and cultural diversity.


An international team of scientists are raising the alarm in a letter published in Nature Ecology & Evolution. "Increasing wildfires threaten progress on halting deforestation in Brazilian Amazonia" is co-authored by researchers at the University of East Anglia (UEA) and the University of South Alabama, which led the study. Other contributors include Michigan State University, the National Institute for Space Research in Brazil and other institutions in North America, South America and Europe.

In June 2023, the number of active fires in the Amazon reached the highest peak since 2007. Total fire counts for the first half of 2023 were 10% higher than in 2022.

Dr. Matthew Jones, a Reseach Fellow in UEA's School of Environmental Sciences and a co-author of the letter, said, "Climate change has led to a rise in drought and extreme heat, priming forests to burn more often.

"On top of this, deforestation and the expansion of agriculture have damaged the integrity of the region's forests and weakened their resilience to drought.

"As a result, wildfires have become far more common than they would be in a normally functioning rainforest."

Previous spikes in fire counts, including the record-breaking fires for a non-drought year in August and September 2022, were associated with widespread deforestation, a primary source of fire and a strong predictor of burned area.

Deforestation rates have been falling in 2023, with alerts 42% lower between January and July than in the same period of 2022. Environmental gains in the region also include the closure of major illegal mining operations that threaten the ecosystem and Indigenous communities, particularly in Yanomami territory.

Dr. Gabriel de Oliveira, an assistant professor at the University of South Alabama, is the lead author of the letter.

Dr. de Oliveira said, "This year's high and climbing fire counts, in the context of reduced deforestation, highlight a decoupling of forest fires from deforestation. Indeed, only 19% of the fires were related to recent deforestation during January–June 2023, down from 39% in 2022."

  Why do some recent wildfires spread so fast? An analysis of three of the worst impacts on urban wildlife interface in recent years

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three memorable wildfires have recently<br>
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;made headlines around the world for how fast<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they spread, how intensely they burned and<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the lives they claimed;
      the Lahainas fire on &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hawaii, Lytton, BC and West Kelowna, BC.

  The CBC reported on September 11:  "When wildfires move fast, the people in their path are left with little choice but to flee... And wildfires are moving more aggressively than ever, forcing entire communities from their homes and leaving destruction in their wake."

  In June 2021, a fast-moving fire destroyed the majority of the village of Lytton, B.C., killing two elderly people who became trapped by the advancing flames.

  Earlier this summer on the Hawaiian island of Maui, a deadly fire ripped through the historic town of Lahaina so quickly that people fled into the ocean to escape the flames. So far, 115 people have been confirmed dead and 66 more are still missing.

  Last month, what began as a small fire in West Kelowna grew more than a hundredfold. Over a 24 hour period it grew from 64 hectares to 6,800 hectares (68 square kilometres). It became  one of the fastest moving wildfires in B.C.‘s history. Over the course of the next few days, 170 structures were damaged or destroyed, and thousands were forced to evacuate.

  “Compared to when I was a wildland firefighter, it seems like fires are different,” said Mathieu Bourbonnais, a former firefighter who is now an assistant professor of Earth, Environmental and Geographic Sciences at the University of British Columbia’s Okanagan campus.

  These fires are faster and more aggressive, according to Bourbonnais. This makes them more dangerous to fight, and they are now more of a threat to the people who live close to affected areas.

  By analyzing three factors: weather conditions, topography and fuel, those who fight and study fires say they can better understand and predict the conditions that lead to these fast-moving and destructive blazes and help prepare for a future where more fire is certain.
